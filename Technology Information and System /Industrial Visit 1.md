This industrial visit focused on project management and system development. This industrial visit enhanced my understanding of these areas particularly the top reasons of project failure. 

Poor communication : creates misunderstandings between teams and increasing errors.
Poor preparation : can cause project objectives to be unclear, leading to delay and inefficient use of resources.
Bad leadership : affects decision making, resulting in low performance and lack of direction.

I also visited several booths including Dell Technologies and D-Ron where I gained insights into current technologies and real world industry applications.

Dell Technologies : I learned that there are many types of laptops designed to suit different specifications and user needs. 
D-Ron : I learned how advanced technologies are applied in security systems especially for person detection and monitoring.

The explanation at some booths could be improved by providing more detailed and structured information and more hands-on demonstrations would help enhance understanding of the technologies presented.

Reflection : This industrial visit was a valuable experience that enhanced my understanding of project management, system development as well as real world technology applications. It makes me realize the importance of proper planning, effective communication and strong teamwork in order to ensure the project success. The visit also increased my awareness of current industry practices and motivated me to further improve my soft skills and technical skills.
