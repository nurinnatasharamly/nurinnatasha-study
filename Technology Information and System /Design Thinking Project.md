Design Thinking Project : CyberCare(CC) : A Smart Online Counseling Platform for Cyberbullying Victims

The CyberCare (CC) project was developed from 21 October 2025 to 10 January 2026. It was successfully presented on 14 January 2026 by my team members and I, highlighting our teamwork and the skills gained throughout the project.Throughout this project, we applied the five phases of design thinking which is empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test in order to address a real world issue in a structured and user centered way.

- Project Overview
CyberCare (CC) is a smart online counseling platform designed to support individuals affected by cyberbullying. The platform aims to reduce barriers that prevent victims from seeking help, such as privacy concerns, fear of judgment, and limited access to professional counselling services.

- Problem Identified
  -Many hesitate to seek help because of privacy concerns, fear of being judged, and limited access to professional support.
  -Students and young adults who experience cyberbullying often face emotional distress, anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression due to online harassment.

-Key Features Proposed
 -AI-powered chatbot : available 24/7 for immediate emotional support.
 -Counselling sessions : professional counsellors via online or physical.
 -Booking form : allows users to schedule counseling sessions based on available time slots.

Reflection : My goal with regard to network and security is to build and manage network systems that are secure, reliable, and efficient. I want to pursue a career in cybersecurity by developing the skills needed to protect systems, networks and data from cyber threats. 

Design thinking gives impact to this goal by encouraging a user-centered and problem-focused approach which allows me to understand real world needs and potential risks before implementing the solution. This ensures that network and security measures are not only technically strong but also practical and usable.

I need to continuously develop my team working skills, stay up to date with current technologies and strengthen my soft skills such as communication and problem solving to meet industry expectations in order to improve my potential in the industry. 

Last but not least, I would like to thank my lecturer, Dr. Suriati binti Sadimon, for her guidance, as well as my team members, Nurul Iman, Nurul Hafizzah, and Sharifah Nadiah, for their teamwork and dedication in ensuring the success of this project.
