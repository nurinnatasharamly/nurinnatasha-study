During the visit to Johor Port Berhad, I attended presentations about their information technology systems and how technology supports port operations. The briefing delivered by Ts. Mohamad Taufik Abdul Razak as IT Manager and Tn Hj Badrul Hisham Abdul Halim as Head of Infrastructure.

From the briefing, I learned that ICT is essential to manage the complexities of a modern port. The ICT department organized into four main pillars:

- Infrastructure : foundation of the port’s connectivity and ensures all digital systems run smoothly and reliably
- Business application : taking care of the port’s important software systems, like CATOS and JPBI. This pillar also helps the port process ships and trucks efficiently, reduce mistakes, and keep cargo information accurate.
- Project & Governance : the way team plans and organizes work.
- Admin & Helpdesk : ICT Administration manages and maintains IT systems while ICT Helpdesk helps users fix problems.

Reflection : This industry visit provided an exposure to a real world applications of technology in a large scale operations. This experience definitely enhanced my interest in cybersecurity field as well as motivate me to develop technical skills that relevant to the industry which essential for my future career.
