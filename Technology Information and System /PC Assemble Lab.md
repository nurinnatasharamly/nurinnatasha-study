In the PC Assembly Lab, I had the opportunity to assemble a CPU and then disassemble it, which provided hands-on experience with computer hardware such as removing the wires connected, power supply, RAM, hard disk as well as the CPU fan. After assembled it back, we switched on to test it and the PC worked well showing that all the assemble step are correct.

The session taught me how to carefully install and remove components, emphasizing the importance of proper handling and safety. By performing the assembly and disassembly, I gained a deeper understanding of how each part fits and functions within a computer system. This practical experience also reinforced the theoretical knowledge learned in class about computer hardware and its organization.
