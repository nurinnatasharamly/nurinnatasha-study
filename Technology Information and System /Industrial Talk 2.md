Date : 18th December 2025
Time : 2:00 p.m.
Venue : Webex Meeting ( online )
Speaker : Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim bin Abdul Muttalib, Head of Technology and Innovation of Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd

Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim expose how project management and system development are applied in the workplace and why they are very important to the IT industry and future careers. 

 Project Management
- Waterfall methodology : traditional approach, which is a linear and sequential approach that requires finishing one phase before starting the next phase. This phase is particularly beneficial in environments with clear and consistent requirements. 
- Agile methodology : a modern, iterative approach where work is broken into small segments called sprints. It requires constant feedback from the customer throughout the project to ensure that the system meets their actual needs. 

System Development
- Planning : establishes goals, purpose, and desired results. 
- Engineering : gathering and analysis requirements. 
- Documentation : defines and records requirements and specifications. ▪️ Design : creating prototype and visual representations. 
- Development : write component codes. 
- Testing : ensures components, security activities, and systems meet the quality standard. 
- Deployment : launches the software product on the intended platform. ▪️ Maintenance : provides ongoing support and maintenance.

Reflection : This industry talk really changed how I view my future in Network and Security. I realized that being a great student is not just about how fast I can code, but about my ability to act as a system architect who can design secure systems from the ground up. Over the next four years, I plan to follow the 60/40 success formula by focusing more on mastering project management and system design, while using AI tools to handle the basic things.
